    <h2><b>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</b></h2>
        <p>
            I previously learnt some HTML in my CSCI 100 class.<br> 
            They taught us about how to host a beginner friendly website<br>
            with very basic formats such as h1 and h2 codes.

        </p><br><br>

    <h2><b>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?</b></h2>
        <p>
            I used a template that was used in the CSS book that <br>
            I thought was very nice looking that I also modified it<br>
            it to my personal prefrence that I liked.

        </p><br><br>

    <h2><b>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)</b></h2>
        <p>
            The most challenging part of my portifolio has to be the artifact.<br>
            The artifacts were very hard to work with since most of them required<br>
            Javascript and Javascript is not my strength but I was able to learn<br>
            enough for this class.

    <h2><b>How taking this class changed your view on Web Development?</b></h2>
        <p>
            When I first started Web Development, I thought I was going to change<br>
            my major because of how hard it was for me to learn how to code, but<br>
            after a while in this class, I thought I was slowly and steadily getting<br>
            the idea of web development so now, I intend to be a web developer.
        </p><br><br>

    <h2><b>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</b></h2>
        <p>
            I would recommend to future students taking this class to make sure<br>
            they complete all their assignments and ask for help when needed.<br>
            One of the main reasons I was struggling in this class was because<br>
            I was trying to learn all of the codes by myself even when I wasn't<br>
            understanding them.
